# Set-up-a-Hello-Microverse-project

    In this project, I will set up a "Hello world" repository. No complex coding is required for this exercise. My goal here is to master all of the tools and       best practices I learned about in previous steps. I will be using them in all Microverse projects and most likely in my future job as well, so it is           important to know them!
